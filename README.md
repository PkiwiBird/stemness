### Comparison and functional/network analysis of stemness gene sets
Stem cells encompass a variety of different cell types which converge on the dual capacity to self-renew
and differentiate into one or more lineages. These characteristic features are key for the involvement of
stem cells in crucial biological processes such as development and aging. To decipher their underlying
genetic substrate, the identification of stemness genes common to different stem cell types, and consistently
identified across different studies, is of outstanding relevance. In this meta-analysis, 21 individual stemness
signatures for human and another 21 for mouse, obtained from a wide variety of stem cell types and
experimental techniques, were compared. Although we observed biological and experimental variability, a
highly significant overlap between gene signatures was identified. This enabled us to define integrated
stemness signatures (ISSs) comprised of genes most frequently occurring among individual stemness
signatures. Such integrated signatures help to exclude false-positives that can compromise individual
studies and can provide a more robust basis for investigation. To gain further insights into the relevance of
ISSs, their genes were functionally annotated and connected within a molecular interaction network. Most
importantly, the present analysis points to the role of several less well-studied genes in stemness and thus
provides promising candidates for further experimental validation
